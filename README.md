# la-redux
A place to get to know Redux better.

## Projects
[Nomad](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/tree/master/nomad): I wanted to practice test driving [actions](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/blob/master/nomad/src/actions/index.spec.js) and [reducers](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/blob/master/nomad/src/reducers/trips.spec.js) in Redux.

### How to run the tests
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:LNA/la-redux.git`
2. `cd` into nomad
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run the tests `yarn test`
5. If you'd like to practice working in Redux, we could use help with [@some-lab](https://github.com/some-lab)
