# la-redux
A place to get to know Redux better.

## Projects
[Nomad](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/tree/master/nomad): I wanted to practice test driving [actions](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/blob/master/nomad/src/actions/index.spec.js) and [reducers](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/blob/master/nomad/src/reducers/trips.spec.js) in Redux.


[Skincare](https://github.com/LNA/la-redux/tree/master/skincare): Practice testing actions and reducers for my favorite  [skincare products](https://www.sephora.com/product/super-mud-clearing-treatment-P376409?skuId=1901230&icid2=glamglow_bestsellers_carousel:p376409).

## How to run the tests
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:LNA/la-redux.git`
2. `cd` into the project whose tests you'd like to run
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run the tests `yarn test`

## If you'd like to practice working in React
We could use help with [@some-lab](https://github.com/some-lab).
