# Nomad
I wanted to practice test driving actions and reducers in Redux.

## How to run the tests
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:LNA/la-redux.git`
2. `cd` into nomad
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Run the tests `yarn test`
5. If you'd like to practice working in Redux, we could use help with [@some-lab](https://github.com/some-lab)
